# Operational Leverage Framework Overview

## Purpose
This project models public exposure signals and turns them into structured, evidence-first risk narratives for defensive decision support.

Disclaimer:
- Educational/research software.
- Not a security product.
- No guarantees on outcome quality.

## Architecture

  UI[FastAPI + Jinja UI] --> APP[app/routers + services]
  APP --> COLLECT[collector_v2 + connectors]
  APP --> SCORE[signal_model + evidence_quality_classifier]
  SCORE --> RISKS[risk_story / risk briefs]
  APP --> EXPORT[PDF + JSON export]
  CLI[olf-score CLI] --> SCORE
```

## Main outputs
- Assessment state and evidence logs in SQLite.
- Structured risks with confidence metadata.
- Exported PDF and JSON artifacts for stakeholder communication.

## Operational behavior
- One-command local startup (Windows/Linux/macOS): `python scripts/run.py web`.
- The runner opens `http://127.0.0.1:56461` after the app is reachable (unless `--no-browser` is set).

## Limits and assumptions
- Confidence is heuristic and evidence-dependent.
- Public-source visibility is incomplete by definition.
- Optional API-based connectors may be skipped when keys are not configured.
